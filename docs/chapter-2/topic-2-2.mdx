# Chapter 2 - Topic 2: Architectural Patterns

Building AI-Native systems requires a different set of architectural patterns than traditional software development. These patterns are designed to address the unique challenges of working with data, models, and probabilistic systems.

This topic explores some of the most common architectural patterns for AI-Native systems, including:

*   **The Data-Centric Architecture:** This pattern places data at the center of the system, with all other components designed to support the collection, processing, and analysis of data.
*   **The Model-as-a-Service Architecture:** This pattern treats machine learning models as independent services that can be accessed by other applications via an API.
*   **The Human-in-the-Loop Architecture:** This pattern integrates human feedback into the learning process, allowing the system to learn from its mistakes and improve over time.
*   **The Federated Learning Architecture:** This pattern allows models to be trained on decentralized data without the need to move the data to a central location.
*   **The MLOps Architecture:** This pattern applies the principles of DevOps to the machine learning lifecycle, enabling teams to build, test, and deploy models more quickly and reliably.

By understanding these architectural patterns, you will be able to design and build AI-Native systems that are scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
