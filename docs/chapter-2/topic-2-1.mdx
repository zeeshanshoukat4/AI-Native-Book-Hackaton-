# Chapter 2 - Topic 1: Core Principles of AI-Native

To build effective AI-Native systems, we need a set of guiding principles that can help us navigate the unique challenges and opportunities of this new paradigm. These principles are not rigid rules, but rather a set of heuristics that can be adapted to the specific context of each project.

This topic introduces the core principles of AI-Native development, which are:

*   **Data as a First-Class Citizen:** In AI-Native systems, data is not just something that is processed; it is the lifeblood of the application. The quality, quantity, and availability of data are critical to the success of any AI-Native project.
*   **Continuous Learning:** AI-Native systems are not static; they are designed to learn and adapt over time. This requires a robust infrastructure for collecting, processing, and retraining models on new data.
*   **Probabilistic by Nature:** AI-Native systems are inherently probabilistic, which means that they will not always be 100% accurate. This requires a shift in how we think about testing, monitoring, and user experience.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** While AI can automate many tasks, it is not a replacement for human intelligence. AI-Native systems are designed to augment and amplify human capabilities, not to replace them.
*   **Ethical by Design:** AI has the potential to have a profound impact on society, both positive and negative. It is our responsibility as developers to ensure that we are building AI-Native systems that are fair, transparent, and accountable.

By embracing these principles, we can build AI-Native systems that are not only powerful and intelligent, but also responsible and trustworthy.
