# Chapter 4 - Topic 2: Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is the idea that intelligence is not just a property of the brain, but is also shaped by the body and the environment. This is a radical departure from the traditional view of intelligence, which has tended to focus on abstract reasoning and problem-solving.

This topic explores the concept of embodied intelligence and its implications for robotics and AI. We will discuss how the body and the environment can be used to simplify the problem of intelligence, and we will explore some of the ways that embodied intelligence is being used to build more capable and robust robots.

We will also discuss the philosophical implications of embodied intelligence, and we will consider what it means for our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.

By the end of this topic, you will have a new appreciation for the importance of the body in intelligence, and you will be able to see how the principles of embodied intelligence can be used to build more intelligent and capable robots.
