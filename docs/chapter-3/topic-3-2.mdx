# Chapter 3 - Topic 2: Robotics Frameworks

Building robotic systems is a complex undertaking that requires expertise in a wide range of disciplines, from mechanical engineering to computer science. To help manage this complexity, a number of robotics frameworks have been developed that provide a set of tools and libraries for building robotic applications.

This topic provides an overview of some of the most popular robotics frameworks, including:

*   **Robot Operating System (ROS):** ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.
*   **Gazebo:** Gazebo is a 3D robotics simulator that allows you to test and validate your robotic algorithms in a virtual environment before deploying them on a physical robot.
*   **MoveIt:** MoveIt is a motion planning framework for robotics that provides a set of tools for developing and evaluating motion planning algorithms.
*   **OpenCV:** OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. It is used in a wide range of applications, from image and video processing to object detection and recognition.

By understanding the capabilities of these frameworks, you will be able to choose the right tools for your robotics projects and build more capable and reliable robots.
