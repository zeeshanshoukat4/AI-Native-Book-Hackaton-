# Chapter 1 - Topic 1: The Genesis of AI-Native

The term "AI-Native" represents a fundamental paradigm shift in how we approach software development and system design. It's not merely about integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into existing applications; it's about building systems from the ground up with AI as a core component, a first-class citizen in the architectural landscape.

This chapter explores the genesis of this concept, tracing its roots from the early days of AI to the current explosion of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative technologies. We will delve into the key drivers behind this evolution, including the exponential growth of data, the increasing availability of powerful computing resources, and the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms.

We will also differentiate AI-Native from traditional software development methodologies, highlighting the key differences in mindset, architecture, and development practices. This will lay the foundation for understanding the unique challenges and opportunities that AI-Native presents.

By the end of this topic, you will have a clear understanding of what it means to be AI-Native and why it is poised to become the dominant paradigm for software development in the 21st century.
