# Feature Specification: Docusaurus Book Website

**Feature Branch**: `002-docusaurus-book-site`
**Created**: 2025-12-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Use Docusaurus to implement and create a professional book website with good appearance."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Landing Page (Priority: P1)

As a visitor, I want to see a professional and visually appealing landing page that clearly introduces the book and provides a prominent call-to-action to start reading.

**Why this priority**: The landing page is the primary entry point and must capture the user's interest immediately.

**Independent Test**: The landing page can be tested by running the dev server and ensuring all elements render correctly and the design is polished.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user navigates to the root URL, **When** the page loads, **Then** a hero section with the book title and a brief introduction is displayed.
2. **Given** the landing page is loaded, **When** the user views the page, **Then** a clear CTA button (e.g., "Start Reading") is visible and links to the first chapter of the book.

### User Story 2 - Navigate and Read the Book (Priority: P1)

As a reader, I want to navigate through the book's 5 chapters and 10 topics using a persistent sidebar, read the content in a clean, readable layout, and use built-in pagination to move between topics.

**Why this priority**: The core function of the site is the reading experience. Easy navigation is essential for a good user experience.

**Independent Test**: The book's doc pages can be tested by adding markdown files and verifying that Docusaurus generates the sidebar and content pages correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing a book page, **When** they look at the sidebar, **Then** a hierarchical list of all 5 chapters and their respective topics is visible.
2. **Given** a user clicks on a chapter or topic in the sidebar, **When** the new page loads, **Then** the corresponding content is displayed in the main content area.
3. **Given** a user is at the end of a topic, **When** they click the "Next" button, **Then** they are taken to the next topic in the sequence.

### User Story 3 - Customize Viewing Experience (Priority: P2)

As a reader, I want to be able to switch between light and dark modes to suit my reading preference.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user comfort and accessibility, which contributes to a premium feel.

**Independent Test**: The theme toggle can be tested by clicking the theme switch button and verifying that the color scheme of the entire site updates correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on any page, **When** they click the theme toggle button, **Then** the site's color scheme instantly switches between light and dark modes.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a link to a non-existent chapter/topic is clicked?
- How does the site render on mobile devices, and is the navigation still intuitive?
- How are images and other media handled within the MDX content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The project MUST be initialized using the standard `docusaurus-init` command with the `classic` template.

- **FR-003**: All book content MUST be created as MDX files within the `/docs` directory.
- **FR-004**: The book's structure (5 chapters, 2 topics each) MUST be defined in the `sidebars.js` configuration file to generate the navigation.

- **NFR-TECH-002**: New components MUST be reusable and placed in the appropriate shared directory.
